/*
We have a class Robot
can move, turn left or right 90 degrees, and clean current cell

information about grid: if we can't move into a cell, move will return false

Each cell as a vertex in a graph
Each cell has 4 neighbors / edges

I: an instance of a robot API
O: none; side effect of all rooms cleaned
C: all cells can be visited; look to optimize for time and space
E: avoid looping

move forward as base case
if obstacle is encountered:
- turn until uncleaned space is ahead
- if none, turn until visited path
    - recursively continue moving forward

backtracking solution:

recursive(cell) {
Mark as cleaned
Examine 4 options
If option is not an obstacle and hasnâ€™t been visited, recursive(newCell)
goBack()
}

we have to make consistent 90 degree turns and examine each path for this to work
(not provably sure why but keep this instinct in mind.for similar type problems)
