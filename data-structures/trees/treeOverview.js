/*

Binary tree:

Node {
  this.value = value
  this.left = Node
  this.right = Node
}

N-ary tree:

Node {
  this.value = value
  this.children = [Nodes]
}

Trie:

Node {
  this.value = character
  this.children = [Nodes]
}

Recall that with trees, time complexities depend on if they are balanced or not.
